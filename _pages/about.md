## About me
Greetings! I am a Ph.D. graduate from the [Civil Engineering department](https://iitg.ac.in/civil/site) of  [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in/).  

I have a B.Tech. (Bachelor of Technology) degree in Civil Engineering from [IGIT Sarang](https://igitsarang.ac.in/) and a M.Tech. (Master of Technology) degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management from [IIT Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in/). During my Ph.D. at IIT Guwahati, I worked on characterizing the hydraulic and retention properties of unsaturated and near-saturated soils using experimental and numerical modelling.This research offered a rapid, non-intrusive, and non-invasive means for accurately quantifying the soil hydraulic and retention characteristics using transient flow measurements from disc infiltrometers.


## [Updates]

* Attending 8th International Conference on Unsaturated Soils (UNSAT 2023) in Greece (May 2023) to present on the topic “Determination of wetting soil water characteristics curve from disk infiltrometer measurements”
