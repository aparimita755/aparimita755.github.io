My research aims to critically appraise the potential and utility of infiltration measurements to predict the unsaturated soil hydraulic parameters. 
It is based on experimental evaluation using various infiltrometers, sensor measurements, and optimization tools using numerical modelling technique to evaluate the soil water hydraulic and retention characteristics and the associated hydraulic parameters.

## My research interests are:

*	Subsurface/vadose zone hydrology
*	Unsaturated soil mechanics
*	Hydrological modelling
*	Numerical modelling
