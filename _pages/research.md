My research aims to critically appraise the potential and utility of infiltration measurements to predict the soil water hydraulic and retention characteristics  and the associated hydraulic parameters correspoding to the wetting process. It focusses on experimental evaluation using various infiltrometers and sensor measurements. Additionally, I have used optimization technique using numerical modelling.

## My research interests are:

*	Subsurface/vadose zone hydrology
*	Unsaturated soil mechanics
*	Hydrological modelling
*	Numerical modelling
