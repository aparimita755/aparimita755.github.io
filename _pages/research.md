My research aims to appraise the potential and utility of infiltration measurements to predict the soil hydraulic characteristics in unsaturated soils. It focusses on evaluation of soil water hydraulic and retention characteristics and associated hydraulic parameters using experimental methodolgy by employing infiltrometer and sensor measurements, and numerical modelling technique using optimization tools .


## My research interests are:

*	Infiltration
*	Transient flow analysis
*	Subsurface/vadose zone hydrology
*	Unsaturated soil mechanics
*	Numerical modelling
